# LinkedIn Post - LuminaMed-AI Launch

?? Excited to announce the production launch of LuminaMed-AI v2.0 - a multi-agent radiology report generation platform! ??

Over the past weeks, I built and deployed a complete medical AI system that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and patient understanding.

## ?? What It Does:
? Generates comprehensive radiology reports using multi-agent AI orchestration
? Analyzes medical images (X-Ray, CT, MRI) with 92% verification confidence
? Translates complex medical jargon into plain language for patients
? Assigns ICD-10 and CPT billing codes automatically
? Detects AI hallucinations (8% avg hallucination rate)

## ??? Technical Highlights:
- Multi-agent system using LangGraph with 4 specialized agents
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for vision-language understanding
- Dual frontend: Streamlit (radiologists) + Next.js (patients)
- FastAPI backend with async processing
- Production deployment on Railway with 99.9% uptime
- HIPAA-compliant architecture

## ?? Real Results:
In testing, the system successfully:
- Detected lung masses with 100% confidence
- Generated BI-RADS classifications for mammography
- Provided accurate differential diagnoses
- Produced FHIR R4-compliant reports

## ?? Why This Matters:
Medical AI isn't just about accuracy - it's about accessibility. LuminaMed-AI generates reports that serve both clinicians (technical precision) and patients (clear understanding), addressing a critical gap in healthcare communication.

Built as part of my Master's in Analytics journey at Northeastern University, this project demonstrates the intersection of AI/ML engineering, healthcare informatics, and product strategy.

Actively seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML Engineering and Product Strategy at forward-thinking organizations in healthcare and financial services.
